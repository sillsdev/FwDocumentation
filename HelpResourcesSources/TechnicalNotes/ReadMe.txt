# TechnicalNotes #

This folder contains all the source files for the various "Technical Notes on..."
documents available in FieldWorks under Help/Resources.

Because most of these documents are binary files which do not merge well, and since they have been written and maintained by Ken Zook, if you plan to modify any of these documents, please notify Ken of the file(s) you are changing so two people are not working on them at the same time.

When any of these documents are modified, the result is to be checked in to:
